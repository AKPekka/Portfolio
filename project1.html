                    <p id="projectDescription">Astranew is a novel, waterless clothing sanitation system designed to solve the critical challenge of textile waste in long-duration space missions. Conventional laundry is impossible in microgravity, forcing astronauts to discard hundreds of pounds of clothing per mission—wasting both mass and resources at staggering cost. Astranew addresses this by enabling safe, closed-loop garment reuse through advanced UV-C sterilization and high-efficiency airflow, all within a compact, spacecraft-compatible enclosure. The system achieves over 99.9% bacterial reduction in less than five minutes, with complete sterilization and deodorization cycles completed in under twenty minutes—dramatically exceeding NASA's requirements while using no water, chemicals, or consumables.</p>
                    <p> Beyond its technical achievements, Astranew was engineered for real-world spacecraft integration: a robust aluminum chassis, custom 3D-printed airflow hangers, replaceable deodorizing cartridges, and a user-friendly Arduino-powered interface all contribute to a reliable, crew-friendly system. The project's development involved extensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, mechanical design for manufacturability, and iterative prototyping and validation—including biological testing and ergonomic user interface development. The prototype not only demonstrated exceptional technical performance but also showed direct commercial viability, with projected launch cost savings of up to $4 million per astronaut and strong demand from both governmental and private space sectors.</p>
                    <p> Astranew's innovative approach and tangible impact were recognized at Purdue University's 2025 Senior Design Expo, where the project was awarded the Sustainability Innovation Award for its contribution to resource-efficient, environmentally conscious engineering. The system sets a new benchmark for sustainable human presence in space, with clear applications for remote or resource-constrained environments on Earth as well.</p>
